> ####**Context Matters**
>
> You should always give context whenever there is any ambiguity in your strings. Below are some example situations that we especially recommend you always give context information for:
>
>####**Strings with variables**
>------------------------------
> Context should be given to any string with a **variable placeholder** inside it so that the translators understands the context of the words around it.
>
> This can be paricular important as some languages may say things in a different order depending on what the subject is. 
> 
> For example, in some languages the phrase "The Falcon 9 has landed" would be written as "Landed has the Falcon 9" or something to that effect.
>
>####**Same words, different meaning**
> ------------------------------
> For example you may have the world ***clear*** appear twice in your project but mean two different things:
>
> **clear (adjective)**: *a transparent substance*. 
>
> or
>
> **clear (adverb)**: *so as to be out of the way of or away from.*
>
> It is important that you give contextual information in situations like this to make sure it still makes sense in a different language.
