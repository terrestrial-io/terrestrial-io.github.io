##Command Line Tool

Ths command line tool contains some commands that will allow you to localize your app & also test quickly.

    $ nik@terrestrial_mainframe: /secret_mars_mission_app > terrestrial --help
    Usage: terrestrial <command> <options>

    Commands
            init             Initialize your project with Terrestrial.
            scan             Detect any new or deleted strings in your app.
            push             Upload the latest strings from your app.
            pull             Download latest translations and generate relevant localization files.
            flight           (iOS only) Find human facing strings in your app that are not currently set for translation.
            ignite <locale>  (iOS only) Start the simulator in a specific locale.
            photoshoot       (iOS only) Start the simulator in photoshoot mode.

###Flight

> `flight` is currently only supported on iOS.

	$ terrestrial flight

Flight is a command that helps you quickly internationalize an application that has not yet been prepared for multiple languages. If you have strings hardcoded in your project, you can use flight to quickly extract them and swap them with the necessary localization function calls.

Terrestrial will traverse your project structure & analyze:

 > **.m** files 
 >
 > **.swift** files 
 >
 > **.storyboard** files 

It will look inside these files for **string literals** and for each string that it finds, it will try to determine whether or not the particular string that it has found is intended to be seen by the end user and hence whether is should be internationalized.

Flight will list all the strings it finds, and you have the ability to exclude any strings that you wish not to translate:

    $ terrestrial flight 
    ...

    -- Instructions --
    - To exclude any strings from translation, type the index of each string.
    -   e.g. 1,2,4

###Scan

	$ terrestrial scan

This command will look through your localization files and compare them with the strings in mission control to highlight any ommissions/additions of strings. To see a full diff, you can run the command with the **`--verbose`** flag.

###Push

	$ terrestrial push

Push will gather strings from your tracked localization files and push them to mission control.

###Pull

	$ terrestrial pull

This will pull down translations from the online dashboard that are ready to be used and create the appropriate localized files.

####iOS

In iOS, the pull command with place **`Localizable.strings`** files in the appropriate .lproj folders in your project. For example a spanish translation will be placed in the **'/es.lproj'** folder.

Don't forget to add the language you've pulled in your project in the Localizations section of your xcode project.

####Android

In Android, the pull command will create the appropriate folder structure according to [android's default localization specification](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/localization.html) and place the translated **`strings.xml`** files in the correct values folders. If you pull down Finnish translations, Terrestrial will create or update a `strings.xml` file in **res/values-fi/strings.xml**.


###Ignite

> `ignite` is currently only supported for iOS projects.

	$ terrestrial ignite <language-code>

Ignite will launch your iOS app in the simulator using the last used build scheme.

###Photoshoot

> `photoshoot` is currently only supported for iOS projects.

	$ terrestrial photoshoot

Photoshoot works like ignite but launches your iOS app in your native language, while also allowing you take screenshots that will generate live UI previews. This allows translators to make sure their translations fit the app's interface directly in the web translation interface.

A green camera icon should appear on the center right of the screen, which you can click to generate and upload the screenshots.
